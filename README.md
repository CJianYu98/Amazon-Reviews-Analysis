### Description
Reviews are a large part of what drives product sales on e-commerce platforms, and the user experience and design of the review section is critical in allowing customers to make informed decisions about their purchases as well as for enabling sellers to gain more insights on their sales. Our team identified several issues with current cormercial review systems. 

Buyers’ POV: Looking through and deciphering reviews is time consuming, and users may encounter spam. Furthermore, there is no way for buyers to filter reviews based on a specific criteria they have in mind.
Sellers’ POV: Unalbe to consolidate reviews in an efficient manner, leading to loss of valuable information which could negatively impact sales.
E-commerce platforms’ POV: Unable to provide competitive advantage over other platforms as they do not have a means of leveraging on textual data. 

Our proposed solution aims to fill the gap on the aforementioned issues through sentiment analysis and topic modelling.
